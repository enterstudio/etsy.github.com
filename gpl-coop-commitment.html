<h2 id="etsy-gpl-coop-commitment">Etsy's GPL Cooperation Commitment</h2>

<p><b>Our Commitment</b></p>

<p>Before filing or continuing to prosecute any legal proceeding or claim
(other than a Defensive Action) arising from termination of a Covered License,
Etsy commits to extend to the person or entity (“you”) accused of violating the
Covered License the following provisions regarding cure and reinstatement,
taken from GPL version 3. As used here, the term ‘this License’ refers to the
specific Covered License being enforced.
</p>

<p>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation
of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
</p>

<p>
Etsy intends this Commitment to be irrevocable, and binding and enforceable
against Etsy and assignees of or successors to Etsy’s copyrights.
</p>

<p>
Etsy may modify this Commitment by publishing a new edition on this page or a
successor location.
</p>
